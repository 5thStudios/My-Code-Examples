This site is currently UNDER DEVELOPMENT!!!.  The solution is broken into 3 seperate projects:
	www- The main website for the project built upon Umbraco 8
	api- The api layer that will eventually connect a future app version of the site with Umbraco and its database
	bl- The business layer that will manage all data going from Umbraco to the www and api projects.
	
In essense, we are using Umbraco as a centralized data storage between both the website and the api that will be managed within the business layer.

*Note: the api project is not built yet.  This will be programmed after the main website is completed.
